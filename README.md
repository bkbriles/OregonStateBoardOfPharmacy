# Oregon State Board of Pharmacy - 2016
This program is a sample test for the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy. There are currently 50 questions (more on the way)
and they are all multiple choice. I realize it would have been easier to initialize the
arrays with a for loop and input stream, but I had to input the data anyway. As it sits now the questions are pulled from 0-49, but Private Sub GetNextQuestion() will be changed to pull at random.

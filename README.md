# Oregon State Board of Pharmacy - 2016
This program is a sample test for the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy. There are currently 50 questions (more on the way)
and they are all multiple choice. As it sits now the questions are pulled from 0-49, but Private Sub GetNextQuestion() will be changed to pull at random and to skip questions that have already been pulled.
